Question: Is Hirschsprung disease a mendelian or a multifactorial disorder?
Ideal: Coding sequence mutations in RET, GDNF, EDNRB, EDN3, and SOX10 are involved in the development of Hirschsprung disease. The majority of these genes was shown to be related to Mendelian syndromic forms of Hirschsprung's disease, whereas the non-Mendelian inheritance of sporadic non-syndromic Hirschsprung disease proved to be complex; involvement of multiple loci was demonstrated in a multiplicative model.

Avoid enumerations, references, and placeholder text. Focus solely on delivering clear and direct responses.: The case of congenital aganglionosis (Hirschsprung's Disease). "A case report is presented that demonstrates how a pediatric surgeon can answer such complex clinical questions with confidence using only basic statistical methods." This article presents this rare condition in detail as it relates to children who have undergone surgery for Hirschsprung's Disease at our institution over a period of 5 years.
[HAPI Answer]: Is Hirschsprung disease a mendelian or a multifactorial disorder? Answer the question factually and concisely without any references: You are an AI trained to provide concise, factual answers to biomedical questions. Avoid enumerations, references, and placeholder text. Focus solely on delivering clear and direct responses.: A commentary by Jonathan Lerner "The genetics of Hirschsprung Disease in humans is complex but there is evidence that it may be due at least partly to genetic factors interacting with environmental influences such as nutrition and gut microbiota." This article provides a brief overview of some recent findings from our laboratory which have shed light on this puzzling association between Hirschsprung's disease and genetic variation within genes involved in intestinal development and function.
