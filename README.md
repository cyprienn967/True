Okay so currently what happens when everything is up and running is the following:
Login (i.e. admin, password123). Saved API key should pop up from database. Can put in new API key, will get stored in database.

Structure:
1. Web - in backend there is server.js which handles database stuff. In W/E/ there is all the frontend stuff for website
2. Rest - will fill in with implementations soon

test

To run this all yourself gonna need to install some packages and shit:
off the top of my head, openai, cors, flask, node idk so many others

To run: 
[/backend] node server.js
[/W/E] npm run dev
click on the localhost link in the terminal
wait like 5 seconds

To do:
Make protectedroute.js 
finish building website frontend i.e. make template specific to us for the rest of it
then, can start writing bias/hallucination/jailbreak/CoT/false-alignments
