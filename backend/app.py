#Backend python script that takes in an API key and uses 
# OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to detect bias in a series of prompts. 
# The script generates responses to the prompts and currently doesn't do much
# since this is just to get the pipeline working but basically yes calls the LLM using the key put it on the website
# and passes the responses back to the front end script (in frontend/src/App.js)
