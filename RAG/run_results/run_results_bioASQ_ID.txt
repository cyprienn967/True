Question #3 | ID: 571529efcb4ef8864c000001
Q: Which antibiotics target peptidoglycan biosynthesis?
Exact Answer (BioASQ gold): colchicine fosfomycin bacitracin vancomycin D-cycloserine seromycin ampicillin cinnamycin ramoplanin muraymycin mersacidin
Ideal Answer (BioASQ gold): Under some conditions, both ramoplanin and vancomycin probes produce helicoid staining patterns along the cylindrical walls of B. subtilis cells. This work has implications for the design of ramoplanin derivatives and may influence how other proposed substrate binding antibiotics are studied. This was confirmed by in vitro studies involving a wall-membrane particulate fraction from Gaffkya homari in which peptidoglycan synthesis from UDP-MurNAc-tetrapeptide was inhibited by ramoplanin but not by vancomycin. New results support a two-state model for septal and peripheral PG synthesis at mid-cell, involvement of essential cell division proteins in PG remodeling, and mid-cell localization of proteins that organize PG biosynthesis and that form the protein translocation apparatus. Antibiotics which inhibit bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis are the most widely used in current clinical practice. Cells treated with ampicillin, D-cycloserine, or fosfomycin had only one chloroplast after cell division, suggesting that the cells divided without chloroplast division. The antibiotics bacitracin and vancomycin showed no obvious effect. Colchicine inhibits Closterium cell elongation after division.  Surprisingly, also cinnamycin of Streptomyces cinnamoneus cinnamoneus), previously known to bind specifically to phosphatidylethanolamin of biological membranes, provoked strong cell wall biosynthetic stress. Other substances include fluorescent derivatives of two PG-binding antibiotics, vancomycin and ramoplanin. The muraymycins constitute a new antibiotic family whose core structure contains a glycosylated uronic acid derivative joined by an aminopropane group to a hexahydro-2-imino-4-pyrimidylglycyl residue (epicapreomycidine) containing dipeptide that is further extended by a urea-valine moiety. The muraymycins inhibited peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Ramoplanin is a cyclicdepsipeptide antibiotic that inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis. The lantibiotic mersacidin inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis at the level of transglycosylation. Ramoplanin, a new lipoglycopeptide antibiotic, inhibits cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis in gram-positive bacteria.

Question #4 | ID: 56c81fd15795f9a73e00000c
Q: Are stress granules involved in the pathogenesis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis?
Exact Answer (BioASQ gold): yes
Ideal Answer (BioASQ gold): Stress granules are cytoplasmic inclusions that repress translation of a subset of RNAs in times of cellular stress, and several proteins implicated in neurodegeneration (i.e. Ataxin-2 and SMN) interact with stress granules. Mutant FUS proteins that cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis incorporate into stress granules. ALS-linked mutations in profilin 1 alter stress granule dynamics, providing further evidence for the potential role of stress granules in ALS pathogenesis. ALS mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism. Yes, stress granules (SGs) have been linked to several pathologies including inflammatory diseases, cancer, viral infection, and neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).

Question #6 | ID: 57169662cb4ef8864c000008
Q: What is the function of 6SRNA in bacteria?
Exact Answer (BioASQ gold): 
Ideal Answer (BioASQ gold): 6S RNA, first described as a ncRNA in E. coli, mimics an open promoter structure, which has a large bulge with two hairpin/stalk structures that regulate transcription through interactions with RNA polymerase. Escherichia coli 6S RNA represents a non-coding RNA (ncRNA), which, based on the conserved secondary structure and previous functional studies, had been suggested to interfere with transcription. The carboxy terminus containing the Arg-Gly-Gly (RGG) repeat domains in these proteins are necessary for cis-repression of transcription activation and HAT activity by the N-terminal glutamine-rich domain. Escherichia coli 6S RNA represents a non-coding RNA (ncRNA), which, based on the conserved secondary structure and previous functional studies, had been suggested to interfere with transcription. 6S RNA-deficient cells are at a disadvantage for survival in stationary phase, a time when 6S RNA regulates transcription. 6S RNA regulation of both sigma(70) and sigma(S) activities contributes to increased cell persistence during nutrient deprivation. 6S RNA acts as a template for the transcription of defined RNA molecules in the absence of DNA. 6S RNA, first described as a ncRNA in E. coli, mimics an open promoter structure, which has a large bulge with two hairpin/stalk structures that regulate transcription through interactions with RNA polymerase. 6S RNA function enhances long-term cell survival. 

-- BioGPT (Raw) --
6S RNA (6S RNA) is a small non-coding RNA found in bacteria that plays a crucial role in regulating transcription. It is involved in the adaptation of bacteria to various environmental stresses, particularly under conditions of nutrient limitation or stationary phase.

Here are some key functions of 6S RNA in bacteria:

1. **Transcription Regulation**: 6S RNA interacts with RNA polymerase and can mimic DNA promoter regions. This interaction allows it to bind to RNA polymerase and prevent the transcription of certain genes, thereby regulating the expression of genes involved in growth and stress responses.

2. **Stress Response**: 6S RNA is implicated in the bacterial response to stress, helping to modulate the expression of stress-related genes and contributing to the survival of bacteria in unfavorable conditions.

3. **Stability of Transcripts**: 6S RNA can influence the stability of mRNAs by modulating the activity of RNA polymerase and affecting the initiation of transcription.

4. **Regulation of Development and Differentiation**: In some bacterial species, 6S RNA is involved in developmental processes, influencing differentiation and the transition between different growth phases.

Overall, 6S RNA serves as a key regulator of gene expression and helps

Question #7 | ID: 5710ade4cf1c32585100002c
Q: What is the suggested therapy for Mycobacterium avium infection?
Exact Answer (BioASQ gold): 
Ideal Answer (BioASQ gold): The activity of TLC G-65 (a liposomal gentamicin preparation), alone and in combination with rifapentine, clarithromycin, clofazimine and ethambutol, was evaluated in the beige mouse (C57BL/6J--bgj/bgj) model of disseminated Mycobacterium avium infection. TLC G-65 in combination with rifapentine appears to be an attractive regimen for the treatment of infections caused by bacteria in the M. avium complex. Rifampin 10 mg/kg daily, ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily, clofazimine 100 mg every day, and ethambutol 15 mg/kg orally daily for 24 weeks, with or without amikacin 10 mg/kg intravenously or intramuscularly 5 days weekly for the first 4 weeks. In vivo phage treatment may also be used in some cases. Rifampin 10 mg/kg daily, ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily, clofazimine 100 mg every day, and ethambutol 15 mg/kg orally daily for 24 weeks, with or without amikacin 10 mg/kg intravenously or intramuscularly 5 days weekly for the first 4 weeks The activity of TLC G-65 (a liposomal gentamicin preparation), alone and in combination with rifapentine, clarithromycin, clofazimine and ethambutol, was evaluated in the beige mouse (C57BL/6J--bgj/bgj) model of disseminated Mycobacterium avium infection

-- BioGPT (Raw) --
The suggested therapy for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection typically includes a combination of antibiotics. The standard treatment regimen often consists of:

1. **Clarithromycin** or **Azithromycin**: These are macrolide antibiotics and are usually the cornerstone of treatment.
2. **Ethambutol**: This is often included in the regimen to enhance efficacy and prevent resistance.
3. **Rifampin** or **Rifabutin**: These may be added for more severe cases or in individuals with disseminated MAC disease.

The treatment duration generally lasts at least 12 months after the last positive culture or resolution of symptoms, depending on the patient's clinical response and other factors.

It's essential for patients to be monitored regularly for efficacy and potential side effects of the medications. Adjustments to therapy may be necessary based on individual response and tolerance. Always consult a healthcare provider for personalized medical advice.

Question #8 | ID: 515df063298dcd4e51000029
Q: What is the indication for prophylactic use of antibiotics in COPD?
Exact Answer (BioASQ gold): Reduction of number of exacerbations
Ideal Answer (BioASQ gold): In a subset of patients with severe disease and prone to developing infections prophylactic use of antibiotics may reduce number of exacerbations and improve social and health care costs.

-- BioGPT (Raw) --
Prophylactic use of antibiotics in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is primarily indicated in patients with a history of frequent exacerbations, specifically those who experience three or more exacerbations per year. It may be considered in individuals who have moderate to severe COPD, particularly when they have a history of exacerbations that are often bacterial in nature. 

The aim of prophylactic antibiotic therapy in these situations is to reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations, leading to improved quality of life and potentially reducing hospitalizations. Long-term macrolide antibiotics, like azithromycin, have been used in this context based on studies that have shown a reduction in exacerbation rates in certain COPD patients.

However, the decision to use prophylactic antibiotics should be individualized, weighing the potential benefits against the risks of antibiotic resistance and side effects. It is important for such treatments to be conducted under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

Question #9 | ID: 551c2cd26b348bb82c00000d
Q: Does helicobacter pylori infection increase risk for ischemic stroke?
Exact Answer (BioASQ gold): 
Ideal Answer (BioASQ gold): Findings regarding association between helicobacter pylori infection and ischemic stroke risk are conflicting. There is evidence to suggest that helicobacter pylori infection is associated with increased risk for ischemic stroke and should be considered stroke risk factors. However, some studies reported no association between helicobacter pylori infection and stroke.

-- BioGPT (Raw) --
Yes, there is evidence to suggest that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection may be associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. Some studies have indicated that chronic infection with H. pylori can lead to systemic inflammation and other risk factors that contribute to cardiovascular diseases, including ischemic stroke. H. pylori is known to cause chronic gastritis and has been linked to other conditions such as peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer, but its role in cerebrovascular events has garnered attention in the context of inflammation and vascular health.

However, it's essential to note that the relationship between H. pylori and ischemic stroke is still an area of ongoing research, and while there is a potential link, causation has not been definitively established. Further studies are needed to better understand the mechanisms and to clarify the extent of the risk associated with H. pylori infection in relation to ischemic stroke. If you are concerned about H. pylori and its potential health implications, it would be advisable to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and appropriate testing.

Question #10 | ID: 513eec89bee46bd34c00000d
Q: What is the biological role of expansins in fungi?
Exact Answer (BioASQ gold): 
Ideal Answer (BioASQ gold): Expansins are extracellular proteins that increase plant cell-wall extensibility. These wall-loosening proteins are involved in cell wall extension and polysaccharide degradation. In fungi expansins and expansin-like proteins have been found to localize in the conidial cell wall and are probably involved in cell wall remodeling during germination.

-- BioGPT (Raw) --
Expansins are a class of proteins that play a crucial role in the growth and development of fungal cell walls. Their primary biological function is to facilitate cell wall loosening and expansion, which is essential for fungal morphogenesis, including processes such as hyphal elongation and colony expansion.

The mechanisms by which expansins operate involve the disruption of non-covalent interactions in the cell wall matrix, allowing for the accommodation of turgor pressure and further cell wall modification. This activity contributes to various physiological processes in fungi, such as the penetration of host tissues during pathogenic interactions, nutrient acquisition, and environmental adaptation.

In summary, expansins help regulate the dynamics of the fungal cell wall, facilitating growth and enabling fungi to navigate their environments effectively.
