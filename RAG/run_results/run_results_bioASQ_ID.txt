Question #3 | ID: 571529efcb4ef8864c000001
Q: Which antibiotics target peptidoglycan biosynthesis?
Exact Answer (BioASQ gold): colchicine fosfomycin bacitracin vancomycin D-cycloserine seromycin ampicillin cinnamycin ramoplanin muraymycin mersacidin
Ideal Answer (BioASQ gold): Under some conditions, both ramoplanin and vancomycin probes produce helicoid staining patterns along the cylindrical walls of B. subtilis cells. This work has implications for the design of ramoplanin derivatives and may influence how other proposed substrate binding antibiotics are studied. This was confirmed by in vitro studies involving a wall-membrane particulate fraction from Gaffkya homari in which peptidoglycan synthesis from UDP-MurNAc-tetrapeptide was inhibited by ramoplanin but not by vancomycin. New results support a two-state model for septal and peripheral PG synthesis at mid-cell, involvement of essential cell division proteins in PG remodeling, and mid-cell localization of proteins that organize PG biosynthesis and that form the protein translocation apparatus. Antibiotics which inhibit bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis are the most widely used in current clinical practice. Cells treated with ampicillin, D-cycloserine, or fosfomycin had only one chloroplast after cell division, suggesting that the cells divided without chloroplast division. The antibiotics bacitracin and vancomycin showed no obvious effect. Colchicine inhibits Closterium cell elongation after division.  Surprisingly, also cinnamycin of Streptomyces cinnamoneus cinnamoneus), previously known to bind specifically to phosphatidylethanolamin of biological membranes, provoked strong cell wall biosynthetic stress. Other substances include fluorescent derivatives of two PG-binding antibiotics, vancomycin and ramoplanin. The muraymycins constitute a new antibiotic family whose core structure contains a glycosylated uronic acid derivative joined by an aminopropane group to a hexahydro-2-imino-4-pyrimidylglycyl residue (epicapreomycidine) containing dipeptide that is further extended by a urea-valine moiety. The muraymycins inhibited peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Ramoplanin is a cyclicdepsipeptide antibiotic that inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis. The lantibiotic mersacidin inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis at the level of transglycosylation. Ramoplanin, a new lipoglycopeptide antibiotic, inhibits cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis in gram-positive bacteria.

Question #4 | ID: 56c81fd15795f9a73e00000c
Q: Are stress granules involved in the pathogenesis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis?
Exact Answer (BioASQ gold): yes
Ideal Answer (BioASQ gold): Stress granules are cytoplasmic inclusions that repress translation of a subset of RNAs in times of cellular stress, and several proteins implicated in neurodegeneration (i.e. Ataxin-2 and SMN) interact with stress granules. Mutant FUS proteins that cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis incorporate into stress granules. ALS-linked mutations in profilin 1 alter stress granule dynamics, providing further evidence for the potential role of stress granules in ALS pathogenesis. ALS mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism. Yes, stress granules (SGs) have been linked to several pathologies including inflammatory diseases, cancer, viral infection, and neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).

Question #6 | ID: 57169662cb4ef8864c000008
Q: What is the function of 6SRNA in bacteria?
Exact Answer (BioASQ gold): 
Ideal Answer (BioASQ gold): 6S RNA, first described as a ncRNA in E. coli, mimics an open promoter structure, which has a large bulge with two hairpin/stalk structures that regulate transcription through interactions with RNA polymerase. Escherichia coli 6S RNA represents a non-coding RNA (ncRNA), which, based on the conserved secondary structure and previous functional studies, had been suggested to interfere with transcription. The carboxy terminus containing the Arg-Gly-Gly (RGG) repeat domains in these proteins are necessary for cis-repression of transcription activation and HAT activity by the N-terminal glutamine-rich domain. Escherichia coli 6S RNA represents a non-coding RNA (ncRNA), which, based on the conserved secondary structure and previous functional studies, had been suggested to interfere with transcription. 6S RNA-deficient cells are at a disadvantage for survival in stationary phase, a time when 6S RNA regulates transcription. 6S RNA regulation of both sigma(70) and sigma(S) activities contributes to increased cell persistence during nutrient deprivation. 6S RNA acts as a template for the transcription of defined RNA molecules in the absence of DNA. 6S RNA, first described as a ncRNA in E. coli, mimics an open promoter structure, which has a large bulge with two hairpin/stalk structures that regulate transcription through interactions with RNA polymerase. 6S RNA function enhances long-term cell survival. 

-- BioGPT (Raw) --
6S RNA, also known as 6S RNA (small RNA), plays a crucial role in bacterial gene regulation, particularly during stationary phase and in response to nutrient deprivation. Here are some of its key functions:

1. **Regulation of RNA Polymerase**: 6S RNA binds to the RNA polymerase enzyme and sequesters it, preventing it from transcribing certain genes. This is particularly important during periods when the cell's growth is arrested.

2. **Global Gene Regulation**: It acts as a global regulator by influencing the transcription of multiple target genes, enabling bacteria to adapt to stress conditions like starvation or changes in nutrient availability.

3. **Interaction with Other RNAs**: 6S RNA can interact with various other small RNA molecules and regulatory elements, contributing to the network of gene regulation in the cell.

4. **Role in Biofilm Formation**: Some studies suggest that 6S RNA might play a role in the formation of biofilms, which are communities of bacteria that adhere to surfaces and are surrounded by a protective matrix.

5. **Stress Response**: The expression of 6S RNA is typically upregulated under stress conditions, helping the bacteria to efficiently manage resources and maintain survival during challenging environments.

Question #7 | ID: 5710ade4cf1c32585100002c
Q: What is the suggested therapy for Mycobacterium avium infection?
Exact Answer (BioASQ gold): 
Ideal Answer (BioASQ gold): The activity of TLC G-65 (a liposomal gentamicin preparation), alone and in combination with rifapentine, clarithromycin, clofazimine and ethambutol, was evaluated in the beige mouse (C57BL/6J--bgj/bgj) model of disseminated Mycobacterium avium infection. TLC G-65 in combination with rifapentine appears to be an attractive regimen for the treatment of infections caused by bacteria in the M. avium complex. Rifampin 10 mg/kg daily, ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily, clofazimine 100 mg every day, and ethambutol 15 mg/kg orally daily for 24 weeks, with or without amikacin 10 mg/kg intravenously or intramuscularly 5 days weekly for the first 4 weeks. In vivo phage treatment may also be used in some cases. Rifampin 10 mg/kg daily, ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily, clofazimine 100 mg every day, and ethambutol 15 mg/kg orally daily for 24 weeks, with or without amikacin 10 mg/kg intravenously or intramuscularly 5 days weekly for the first 4 weeks The activity of TLC G-65 (a liposomal gentamicin preparation), alone and in combination with rifapentine, clarithromycin, clofazimine and ethambutol, was evaluated in the beige mouse (C57BL/6J--bgj/bgj) model of disseminated Mycobacterium avium infection

-- BioGPT (Raw) --
The suggested therapy for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection typically includes a combination of antibiotics. The standard treatment regimen often consists of:

1. **Macrolides**: Azithromycin or clarithromycin is commonly used as a cornerstone of treatment.
2. **Rifamycins**: Rifampin is frequently added to the regimen.
3. **Ethambutol**: This drug is usually included as well to enhance the effectiveness of the treatment.

A typical treatment duration is at least 12 months, and the exact regimen may vary based on factors such as the patient's overall health, the severity of the infection, and any possible resistance patterns. Depending on the patient's individual needs, additional medications or adjustments to the treatment plan may be warranted. 

It is essential for patients to work closely with their healthcare provider to monitor the effectiveness of the therapy and adjust it as necessary. Regular follow-up and assessment of treatment response are crucial in managing MAC infections.

Question #8 | ID: 515df063298dcd4e51000029
Q: What is the indication for prophylactic use of antibiotics in COPD?
Exact Answer (BioASQ gold): Reduction of number of exacerbations
Ideal Answer (BioASQ gold): In a subset of patients with severe disease and prone to developing infections prophylactic use of antibiotics may reduce number of exacerbations and improve social and health care costs.

-- BioGPT (Raw) --
The prophylactic use of antibiotics in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is primarily indicated to prevent exacerbations of the condition, particularly in patients who experience frequent exacerbations or have a history of severe exacerbations. Antibiotics may be considered for prophylaxis in the following situations:

1. **Frequent Exacerbations**: Patients with a history of two or more exacerbations per year, often leading to hospitalization or significant morbidity.
  
2. **Chronic Bronchitis**: Patients with stable chronic bronchitis who may benefit from the reduction of bronchial infections that can lead to exacerbations.

3. **Severe COPD**: Patients with severe or very severe COPD (GOLD stage III or IV), where the risk of exacerbations is higher.

4. **Specific Pathogen Presence**: If there is a need to target specific pathogens (e.g., if there is evidence or risk of infection by certain bacteria).

5. **Personalized Medicine Approach**: If a patient's history indicates that their exacerbations are associated with bacterial infections.

It's important to note that the use of prophylactic antibiotics should be individualized and based on clinical judgment, considering potential side effects, antibiotic resistance, and patient-specific factors. Long-term
