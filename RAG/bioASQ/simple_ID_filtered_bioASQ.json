      "ideal_answer": [
        "Under some conditions, both ramoplanin and vancomycin probes produce helicoid staining patterns along the cylindrical walls of B. subtilis cells. This work has implications for the design of ramoplanin derivatives and may influence how other proposed substrate binding antibiotics are studied. This was confirmed by in vitro studies involving a wall-membrane particulate fraction from Gaffkya homari in which peptidoglycan synthesis from UDP-MurNAc-tetrapeptide was inhibited by ramoplanin but not by vancomycin. New results support a two-state model for septal and peripheral PG synthesis at mid-cell, involvement of essential cell division proteins in PG remodeling, and mid-cell localization of proteins that organize PG biosynthesis and that form the protein translocation apparatus.",
        "Antibiotics which inhibit bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis are the most widely used in current clinical practice. Cells treated with ampicillin, D-cycloserine, or fosfomycin had only one chloroplast after cell division, suggesting that the cells divided without chloroplast division. The antibiotics bacitracin and vancomycin showed no obvious effect. Colchicine inhibits Closterium cell elongation after division.  Surprisingly, also cinnamycin of Streptomyces cinnamoneus cinnamoneus), previously known to bind specifically to phosphatidylethanolamin of biological membranes, provoked strong cell wall biosynthetic stress. Other substances include fluorescent derivatives of two PG-binding antibiotics, vancomycin and ramoplanin. The muraymycins constitute a new antibiotic family whose core structure contains a glycosylated uronic acid derivative joined by an aminopropane group to a hexahydro-2-imino-4-pyrimidylglycyl residue (epicapreomycidine) containing dipeptide that is further extended by a urea-valine moiety. The muraymycins inhibited peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Ramoplanin is a cyclicdepsipeptide antibiotic that inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis. The lantibiotic mersacidin inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis at the level of transglycosylation. Ramoplanin, a new lipoglycopeptide antibiotic, inhibits cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis in gram-positive bacteria."

Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer.\nRetroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.

      "ideal_answer": [
        "Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is universally used to recognize and remove many types of DNA damage. In eubacteria, the NER system typically consists of UvrA, UvrB, UvrC, the UvrD helicase, DNA polymerase I, and ligase.  Damage recognition during bacterial NER depends upon UvrA, which binds to the damage and loads UvrB onto the DNA. Subsequently, UvrA, UvrB and UvrC form the excinuclease protein UvrABC endonuclease, a multi-enzymatic complex which carries out repair of damaged DNA in sequential manner. In some cases, Cho may be the effective nuclease for NER, rather than UvrC. UvrC nuclease and the short oligonucleotide that contains the DNA lesion are removed from the post-incision complex by UvrD, a superfamily 1A helicase. In gram-positive organisms, PcrA helicase can also displace UvrC and the excised oligonucleotide from a post-incision NER complex."

Moreover, lateral transfer of genes among bacteria has occurred frequently, particularly for plasmid-encoded systems, suggesting that such genes can be acquired fairly readily even if they are not initially present. Finally, although mutations that enable transporters to act on different types of substrate are rare, experiments and phylogenetic analyses indicate that simple point mutations can readily narrow or broaden a particular transporter's specificity toward a single class of compounds (e.g., sugars, amino acids, or drugs)."

      "ideal_answer": [
        "MutT proteins belong to a class of Nudix hydrolases. The common substrate structure for the proteins of the functionally diverse Nudix superfamily is nucleotide-diphosphate-X, where X is a large variety of leaving groups. The activities of Nudix hydrolases usually result in the release of an inorganic phosphate ion or of a product bearing a terminal phosphate moiety. MutT proteins hydrolyze 8-oxo-G nucleoside triphosphates/diphosphates to the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates and sanitize the nucleotide pool. MutT proteins cleave 8-oxo-dGTP (8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate) at the \u03b1-\u03b2 position; they also cleave 8-oxo-dGTP at the \u03b2-\u03b3 phosphate bond at a rate of 3% of that recorded for hydrolysis at the \u03b1-\u03b2 position. 8-oxo-dGTP induces A to C transversions when misincorporated in DNA opposite to template A. By hydrolyzing 8-oxo-dGTP before their incorporation into DNA, MutT proteins play a critical role in allowing bacteria to avoid A-to-C mutations, which are a hallmark of MutT deficiency. Thus, MutT proteins prevent oxidative DNA lesions, as part of the GO system. Oxidized nucleotides can occur when bacteria are exposed to reactive oxygen species. Also, reactive oxygen species are produced as side products of oxygen utilization, leading to the oxidation of nucleic acids and their precursor nucleotides. Distinct from the Escherichia coli MutT, which hydrolyzes 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP, the mycobacterial proteins hydrolyze not only 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP but also dCTP and 5-methyl-dCTP. Moreover, the hydrolysis of 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP in mycobacteria seems to be catalysed in a two-stage mechanism, since MutT converts these oxidized nucleoside triphosphates to their corresponding nucleoside diphosphates, and not to monophosphates."

This avoids the potentially detrimental head-on collisions that occur between the replication and transcription machineries when genes are encoded on the lagging strand.

Genes of some functional categories such as ribosome have higher preferences to be on the leading strands, while genes of other functional categories such as transcription factor have higher preferences on the lagging strands. Strand-biased gene distribution correlates with replication-associated purine asymmetry and the presence or absence of polC.

Ada functions in DNA repair by direct dealkylation of alkylated DNA lesions, such as the toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic O6-alkylguanine (O6-AlkG) and O4-alkylthymine (O4-AlkT) which are restored to guanine and thymine. Ada accepts stoichiometrically the alkyl group from O6-alkylguanine in DNA at the Cys-321 residue and from alkyl phosphotriester at the Cys-69 residue. When methylated at Cys-69, Ada becomes a transcriptional activator of the genes in the ada regulon, including its own. The ada gene controls the inducible resistance to alkylation mutagenesis and killing (the adaptive response). Ada alkyltransferase (ATase) is induced by exposure to low doses of methylating agents. During exponential growth, Ada removes lesions responsible for G:C to A:T transitions and G:C to C:G transversions, while in stationary populations it removes lesions causing G:C to A:T and A:T to G:C transitions, and G:C to C:G, A:T to C:G, and A:T to T:A transversions.

        "A wide range of about 500 different viruses is transmitted by arthropods such as ticks, mosquitoes and sandflies. These arboviruses multiply in the arthropod vector, and for each virus there is a natural cycle involving vertebrates (various birds or mammals) and arthropods. The virus enters the arthropod when the latter takes a blood meal from the infected vertebrate, and passes through the gut wall to reach the salivary gland where replication takes place. Once this has occurred, 1\u20132 weeks after ingesting the virus, the arthropod becomes infectious, and can transmit the virus to another vertebrate during a blood meal. Certain arboviruses that infect ticks are also transmitted directly from adult tick to egg (transovarial transmission), so that future generations of ticks are infected without the need for a vertebrate host."

        "Protective and detectable immune responses are induced after SARS-CoV-2 infection but it is not yet established to what degree and for how long protection against reinfection lasts. Evidence suggests that some of these responses can be detected for at least a year following infection.\n\nThe short-term risk of reinfection (e.g., within the first several months after initial infection) is low. Several studies estimated the risk of reinfection to be less than 1 percent in the subsequent 5-8 months following initial infection. The risk of reinfection may be greater with the Omicron variant."

        "Multiple contexts indicate that infection caused by the Omicron variant of COVID-19 is less severe than infection caused by other variants. Studies have shown that Omicron is associated with milder symptoms and a lower risk of hospitalization compared to previous variants such as Delta. However, it is important to note that not all infected individuals experience a mild Omicron infection, and the severity of the illness can still vary depending on factors such as age and comorbidities.",
        "Early data suggest that COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant is less severe than infection caused by prior variants. Some studies have shown a reduced risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and in-hospital mortality. The relative mildness of disease reported in these studies may reflect the younger age of individuals impacted at this stage of the surge or a higher proportion of reinfections.",
        "COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant appears to be less severe than infections caused by previous variants. Studies have reported milder symptoms and reduced hospitalization rates associated with Omicron infections. For instance, one study found a two-thirds reduction in the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization compared to the Delta variant. Another study comparing first-time SARS-CoV-2 infections during the emergence of Omicron and Delta variants found significantly less severe outcomes for Omicron cases. After adjusting for various factors, the 3-day risks of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and mechanical ventilation were consistently lower in the Omicron cohort compared to the Delta cohort. Furthermore, a large national cohort study assessing relative risks of hospital attendance, admission, or death showed that the risk of severe outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection is substantially lower for Omicron than for Delta. However, it is important to note that not all individuals infected with Omicron experience mild illness."
